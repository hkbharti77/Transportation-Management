# Notification System Enhancements Summary

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the notification system to properly implement all the API endpoints mentioned in the curl commands.

## Implemented API Endpoints

All four notification endpoints from the curl commands are now properly implemented:

1. **POST /api/v1/notifications/{notification_id}/send**
   - Implemented in `notificationService.sendNotification()` method
   - Allows sending individual notifications immediately

2. **POST /api/v1/notifications/send**
   - Implemented in `notificationService.sendTemplateNotifications()` method
   - Allows sending template-based notifications to multiple users

3. **POST /api/v1/notifications/broadcasts?created_by={user_id}**
   - Implemented in `notificationService.createBroadcastNotification()` method
   - Allows creating broadcast notifications with proper created_by parameter

4. **POST /api/v1/notifications/broadcasts/{broadcast_id}/execute**
   - Implemented in `notificationService.executeBroadcast()` method
   - Allows executing broadcast notifications to send them to all recipients

## UI Component Enhancements

### NotificationTable Component
- Added "Send Notification" button for pending notifications that haven't been sent yet
- Implemented `canSendNotification()` helper function to determine when a notification can be sent
- Added `handleSendNotification()` function to handle the send operation
- Improved user feedback when sending notifications

### NotificationForm Component
- Added "Send Notification" button for existing notifications that are pending
- Implemented direct send functionality that updates the notification status after sending
- Maintains consistency with the service layer implementation

### BroadcastTable Component
- Added execution result feedback display
- Shows number of notifications sent and failed after broadcast execution
- Auto-clears the result message after 5 seconds for better UX

## Technical Implementation Details

### Service Layer
The notification service properly handles all HTTP methods and parameters:

- **sendNotification**: Makes POST request to `/notifications/{notification_id}/send`
- **sendTemplateNotifications**: Makes POST request to `/notifications/send` with JSON body
- **createBroadcastNotification**: Makes POST request to `/notifications/broadcasts` with `created_by` query parameter
- **executeBroadcast**: Makes POST request to `/notifications/broadcasts/{broadcast_id}/execute`

### Error Handling
All methods include proper error handling with:
- Authentication token management
- HTTP status code checking
- Error message parsing and propagation
- Type-safe response handling

### Data Models
Updated interfaces to match API responses:
- `SendNotificationResponse` for individual notification send responses
- `TemplateNotificationResponse` for template notification responses
- `ExecuteBroadcastResponse` for broadcast execution responses

## Usage Examples

### Sending an Individual Notification
```typescript
// Send notification with ID 1
const response = await notificationService.sendNotification(1);
console.log(response.status); // "sent"
```

### Sending Template Notifications
```typescript
const templateRequest = {
  user_ids: [1, 3],
  template_name: "Ride Booking Confirmation",
  notification_type: "sms",
  template_variables: {
    user_name: "Amit Sharma",
    booking_id: "RBK123456"
  }
};

const response = await notificationService.sendTemplateNotifications(templateRequest);
console.log(response.success); // true or false
```

### Creating a Broadcast Notification
```typescript
const broadcastData = {
  title: "Flash Sale Alert",
  message: "Hi user_name, enjoy 20% off!",
  notification_type: "sms",
  target_audience: "all_active_users",
  scheduled_at: "2025-09-14T12:00:00.000Z"
};

const response = await notificationService.createBroadcastNotification(broadcastData, 1);
console.log(response.broadcast_id); // 2
```

### Executing a Broadcast Notification
```typescript
const response = await notificationService.executeBroadcast(2);
console.log(response.sent); // 6
console.log(response.failed); // 0
```

## UI Integration

All components properly integrate with the notification service:
- NotificationTable shows send buttons for pending notifications
- NotificationForm allows sending notifications directly from the edit view
- BroadcastTable provides feedback after executing broadcasts
- TemplateNotificationForm handles template-based notification sending

## Testing

All endpoints have been tested with the provided curl commands and work as expected:
- Individual notification sending
- Template notification sending to multiple users
- Broadcast notification creation with created_by parameter
- Broadcast notification execution with result feedback

These enhancements ensure that the notification system is fully functional and provides a complete user experience for managing all types of notifications.
