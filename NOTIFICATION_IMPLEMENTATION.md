# Notification Implementation

This document provides details about the implementation of the notification feature in the Transportation Management system.

## Overview

The notification feature allows administrators to create, manage, and track individual notifications for users. Each notification can be sent immediately or scheduled for a future time. The system supports different notification types (SMS, email, push) and priorities.

## Implementation Details

### Backend API

The feature integrates with the following backend API endpoints:

1. **GET** `/api/v1/notifications/` - Retrieve all notifications
2. **POST** `/api/v1/notifications/` - Create a new notification
3. **GET** `/api/v1/notifications/{notification_id}` - Retrieve a specific notification
4. **PUT** `/api/v1/notifications/{notification_id}` - Update a specific notification
5. **DELETE** `/api/v1/notifications/{notification_id}` - Delete a specific notification
6. **POST** `/api/v1/notifications/{notification_id}/send` - Send a notification immediately
7. **POST** `/api/v1/notifications/{notification_id}/cancel` - Cancel a scheduled notification

### Frontend Components

The implementation includes the following React components:

1. **NotificationManagement** - Main page component that orchestrates the notification management interface
2. **NotificationTable** - Displays a list of all notifications in a table format
3. **NotificationForm** - Form component for creating and editing notifications

### Service Layer

The `notificationService.ts` file provides a clean abstraction over the backend API calls:

- `getNotifications(filters)` - Fetch notifications with optional filtering
- `getNotificationById(notificationId)` - Fetch a specific notification by ID
- `createNotification(notificationData)` - Create a new notification
- `updateNotification(notificationId, notificationData)` - Update an existing notification
- `deleteNotification(notificationId)` - Delete a notification
- `sendNotification(notificationId)` - Send a notification immediately
- `cancelNotification(notificationId)` - Cancel a scheduled notification

## Notification Structure

Each notification contains the following fields:

- `title` - The title or subject of the notification
- `message` - The main content of the notification
- `notification_type` - The type of notification (sms, email, or push)
- `category` - A category for organizing notifications (e.g., booking, trip, order)
- `priority` - The priority level (low, normal, high)
- `user_id` - The ID of the user to receive the notification
- `status` - The current status (pending, sent, delivered, failed, cancelled)
- `scheduled_at` - The time the notification is scheduled to be sent
- `sent_at` - The time the notification was sent
- `delivered_at` - The time the notification was delivered
- `read_at` - The time the notification was read
- `metadata` - An object containing additional data for the notification

## UI Features

1. **Notification Listing** - View all notifications in a sortable table
2. **Create New Notification** - Form for creating new notifications
3. **Edit Existing Notification** - Form for modifying existing notifications
4. **Status Tracking** - View the current status of each notification
5. **Metadata Management** - Define and manage additional notification data
6. **Scheduling** - Schedule notifications to be sent at a future time

## Security

The notification service follows the same authentication patterns as other services in the application:
- Uses Bearer token authentication
- Automatically handles 401/403 responses by redirecting to login
- Properly handles API errors and displays user-friendly messages

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Notification templates for reusable message formats
- Bulk operations (send/cancel multiple notifications)
- Notification analytics and reporting
- Rich text editor for email notifications
- Notification grouping and categorization
- User-specific notification preferences
