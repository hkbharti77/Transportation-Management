# Truck Management Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive truck management system for your Transportation Admin Page that integrates with your existing API endpoint for creating and managing trucks (admin only).

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New API Service
Created `src/services/fleetService.ts` with comprehensive truck management functionality:
```typescript
// Core truck operations
async getTrucks(filters: TruckFilterOptions = {}): Promise<Truck[]>
async getTruckById(truckId: number): Promise<Truck>
async createTruck(truckData: CreateTruckRequest): Promise<Truck>
async updateTruck(truckId: number, truckData: UpdateTruckRequest): Promise<Truck>
async deleteTruck(truckId: number): Promise<ApiResponse<null>>

// Advanced operations
async assignDriverToTruck(truckId: number, driverId: number): Promise<Truck>
async unassignDriverFromTruck(truckId: number): Promise<Truck>
async updateTruckStatus(truckId: number, status: Truck['status']): Promise<Truck>
async updateTruckLocation(truckId: number, lat: number, lng: number): Promise<Truck>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Connection Error**
   - Ensure your backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`
   - Check that the `/api/v1/fleet/trucks` endpoint is accessible
   - Verify your authentication token is valid

2. **Access Denied**
   - Ensure you're logged in as an admin user
   - Check that your user has the "admin" role

3. **No Trucks Displayed**
   - Check the API response format matches expected structure
   - Verify the API is returning data
   - Check browser console for errors

4. **Form Validation Errors**
   - Ensure all required fields are filled
   - Check that numeric values are positive
   - Verify year of manufacture is reasonable

### Debug Information
- All API calls are logged to the console
- Error states are displayed to users
- Loading states provide visual feedback

## Conclusion

The truck management system is now fully integrated with your existing API endpoint and provides a comprehensive interface for managing trucks. The system follows your existing patterns and integrates seamlessly with your current fleet management infrastructure.

All functionality is admin-only as required, and the system handles the API integration gracefully with proper error handling and user feedback.

The system is designed to work alongside your existing user management and fleet management systems, providing a complete fleet management solution for your transportation platform.
