## Environment Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration across different environments:

### Development Environment
File: `.env.development`
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1
```

### Staging Environment
File: `.env.staging`
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1
```

### Production Environment
File: `.env.production`
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-production-api-url.com/api/v1
```

To use these configurations:
1. Create the appropriate `.env` file for your environment
2. The application will automatically load the correct configuration based on the NODE_ENV setting
3. For local development, you can also use `.env.local` which will override other environment files
