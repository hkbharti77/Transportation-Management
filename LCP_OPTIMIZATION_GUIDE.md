# LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) Optimization Guide

This document outlines the optimizations implemented to improve the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metric for the Transportation Management Dashboard.

## Current LCP Status
- **Before Optimization**: 2.98s (needs improvement)
- **Target**: Below 2.5s (good threshold)

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Font Loading Optimization
- Added `display: 'swap'` to font loading to prevent invisible text during font load
- Enabled `preload: true` for critical fonts to prioritize loading

### 2. Image Optimization
- Fixed image paths to use correct relative paths (`/images/logo/logo.svg` instead of `./images/logo/logo.svg`)
- Added `priority={true}` to logo images in the header to preload critical images
- Ensured proper sizing for all images to prevent layout shifts

### 3. Data Fetching Improvements
- Implemented caching for vehicle statistics (5-minute cache)
- Added cache control headers to API requests
- Optimized loading skeletons to reduce perceived load time

### 4. Next.js Configuration
- Enabled experimental optimizeCss for better CSS handling
- Configured image optimization settings
- Fixed configuration error by removing problematic `optimizePackageImports` setting

### 5. Component Structure
- Simplified the main dashboard page to prioritize critical content
- Reduced initial render complexity

## Verification Steps

1. Server starts successfully without errors
2. Images load correctly without 404 errors
3. Font loading uses display swap to prevent invisible text
4. Vehicle statistics are cached to reduce API calls

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Bundle Analysis
Run bundle analysis to identify large dependencies:
```bash
npm run build && npm run analyze
```

### 2. Image Optimization
- Convert SVG logos to optimized formats
- Implement proper image sizing for all assets
- Use Next.js Image component for all images

### 3. Code Splitting
- Implement dynamic imports for non-critical components
- Use React.lazy and Suspense for route-based code splitting

### 4. API Performance
- Implement API response caching on the server-side
- Optimize database queries for vehicle statistics
- Consider implementing pagination for large datasets

### 5. CSS Optimization
- Remove unused CSS classes
- Minimize CSS bundle size
- Use CSS variables for theme consistency

## Monitoring

To monitor LCP improvements:
1. Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab
2. Test with Lighthouse
3. Monitor Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
4. Use web.dev/measure for ongoing performance checks

## Expected Impact

These optimizations should improve LCP by:
- Reducing font loading delays (font swap)
- Prioritizing critical image loading
- Reducing API request frequency through caching
- Improving overall bundle performance

## Testing

After implementing these changes:
1. Run a local production build: `npm run build && npm start`
2. Test with Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
3. Verify LCP is below 2.5s
4. Monitor in real-world usage with Core Web Vitals
